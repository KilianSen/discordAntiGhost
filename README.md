# discordAntiGhost

simple bot, that kicks everyone that is "invisible" in a voice channel.

Disclaimer: The use of a bot like DiscordAntiGhost, which kicks users who are "invisible" in a voice channel, can raise concerns about privacy and user autonomy. While some server owners may argue that it is necessary to ensure transparency and participation in certain channels or activities, others may view it as an infringement on user privacy and the right to control their online presence. It is important for server owners to consider the potential impact of implementing such measures and to clearly communicate their policies and reasoning to users. Ultimately, any decisions regarding user privacy and control should prioritize respect for individual rights and freedoms.
